A classified listing application which allows individuals to dynamically search and post items for sale. Data persistence coupled with a polished user interface allow for an easily searchable catalog. Interactive features, such as Google Maps and Geo-Encoding allow for real-time directions and destinations.

The concept for this application is simply; a web tool that allows you to find the best gear in town. Quickly sell things you list and find great deals nearby. An amazingly simple and different way to buy and sell. 

Users login and create a profile key with their email. This key or user ID (UID), will then track their session and log all activity to Firebase under their specific UID.

Show you great deals nearby on a huge variety of items. Browse your preferred area or search for something specific. Get ahold with other buyers and sellers. Simple to use interface.
